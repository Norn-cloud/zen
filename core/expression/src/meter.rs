//! Norn `metering` feature: a deterministic operation budget.
//!
//! A [`Meter`] is a shared counter of abstract work units with a fixed limit. The
//! expression VM charges it for every executed opcode and for data-proportional work
//! (string, collection and regex builtins), and zen-engine charges graph node and
//! decision-table row visits. Units depend only on the program and its input values,
//! never on time, hash seeds, caching or the target, so the same evaluation exhausts
//! the same budget at the same count natively and on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
//!
//! Once a charge exceeds the limit the meter stays exhausted: every later charge fails
//! with the same [`BudgetExhausted`] value, even if an intermediate caller swallowed
//! the first error.
